Project Title: Personal Tracking App

Project Description:
The Personal Tracking App is a user-friendly desktop application developed using C# and WinForms. It allows users to efficiently capture and manage employee details within an organization. The system provides two distinct login roles: Admin and Employee.

Features:

Admin Login: Administrators can access the system using a secure login. They have privileged access to manage all aspects of the application.

Employee Login: Regular employees can log in with their credentials. Their access is limited to viewing and updating their personal information.

Employee Details: The system captures comprehensive details of each employee, including name, contact information, designation, department, and other relevant data.

Data Security: The application ensures data security by implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Passwords are encrypted to protect sensitive information.

Profile Management: Employees can update their profiles, such as contact information and profile pictures.

Admin Privileges: Administrators have the authority to add, edit, or delete employee records. They can also manage departments, designations, and access rights.

User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive and user-friendly interface makes it easy for both administrators and employees to navigate and interact with the system.

Error Handling: Robust error-handling mechanisms ensure that the application handles unexpected scenarios gracefully, providing a smooth user experience.
